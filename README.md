# Final-project-NL-RC
The project is based on a database of a hospital where they want to see if people tend to have a cardiovascular disease depending on their lifestyle and which factor influence the most.
Cardiovascular diseases or heart diseases represent a challenge in our time, affecting millions despite gender, age, and living conditions. There are multiple factors that might have a positive correlation with a heart attack, including sedentary lifestyles, poor dietary habits, smoking, and stress. This project acts as a response to this challenge, since it consists of the implementation of business analytics and machine learning to create a model which predicts if a patient is going to suffer a heart disease.  
We were provided with a database of multiple public and private hospitals. The database contains detailed information about the previously mentioned risk factors of approximately 308854 patients. This report contains the process we follow from the preprocessing until defining the best model to predict if a person is going to have a heart disease, as well as the implementation cost of this algorithm.
